# HearUs

This project was built during the 24 hour hackathon, CodeCrypt, organized by CUSAT

## Idea

The project is essentially a blockchain based, NFT driven donation platform where we create a scenario where both the benefactors and recipient gets maximum advantage over every single donation made.

## Stack Implementation

Front-End  : Angular JS <br />
Back-End   : Node JS <br />
Database   : FireStore <br />

## Assests

> Images for the NFTs are generated via a model created on top of **Deliberate v3.0 model**, executed via **Stable Diffusion**, by incorporating a custom script that enables us to modify the model to our will and satisfaction, thus enabling us to take maximum advantage of it. <br /><br /><br />
> The Audio files for the NFTs are generated from a model inspired from the **music-gen/small** model provided by **Facebook**. We have utilized our own script to generate custom, themed tunes that serve justice to our theme.

## Execution 

The blockchain network has been hosted on the Polygon Mumbai Test Network, by utilizing Solidity as the medium for contract deployment.
The website is hosted on vercel
